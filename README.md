# Project | Odin Recipes

This is the first real project of The Odin Project. Although rather plain and boring, it is nice to work on my web development skills. 

The goal of this project was to learn about Git, Github and HTML through videos on YouTube and several webpages that contained information about these subjects.

Skills put into practice:

- Git
- Github
- HTML
